ToDo
====

Backbone powered ToDo App

ToDo application that is usable within the browser.
I had tried to be very user centric and tried to make managing ToDo easy and fun. 
This Single Page Application (SPA) runs on its own without any backend service.

User Stories

1. As A User, I want to see an overview of my ToDos
2. As A User, I want to add, edit and remove (CRUD) ToDos
3. As A User, I want to mark and unmark ToDos as ‘Done’
4. As A User, I want to have my ToDos persisted so I don’t have to enter them again if I reload the browser
